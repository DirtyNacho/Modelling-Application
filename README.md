# Modelling-Application
# Description:
* An application that can render and paint animated scenes on the screen with complex models
* The models can have textures and materials assigned to them, this way the light reacts differently to
* the surface of the model
# Used technologies:
* The app is written in C++ using OpenGL library
* All the matrix functions and the specific data structures are implemented in C++
* All the geometry related to models and curves are implemented without using any other libraries
